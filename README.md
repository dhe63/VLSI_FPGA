# VLSI FPGA Design
Super High-Speed Transmission Gate Based FPGA Architecture

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a scalable, fine-grained Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The FPGA design uses the FreePDK process design kit developed by NCSU for the 45nm technology node. This is my final project for the graduate level Electrical and Computer Engineering course: ECE 6130 Advanced VLSI Systems taught by Associate Professor Vincent Mooney at Georgia Institute of Technology.
